# LIGGGHTS_IN_WINDOWS_10  
Latest version of LIGGGHTS  in Windows 10   

The files are ruining in Windows 10 for latest version of LIGGGHTS as DEM solver. The features are:  
(1).Including all functions of LIGGGHTS in serial mode for DEM simulation.   
(2).Unnecessary parts for ruining DEM simulation are deleted, including VTK, BOOST, MPI,et al.   
(3). When running the simulation, just double click the file "LIGGGHTS.exe" and type "include <filename>", such as include packing.txt
